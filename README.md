# TabTranscribe

This is a chrome extensions that automatically transcribes audio from any tab. All of the transcription happens locally on your computer.
No data is send to any servers or third parties.


## Installation

This extension is not officially published on the chrome store.

## How it works

When starting the transcription, a new tab opens which captures the tab you want to transcribe. The audio data is gathered there and then 
sent to a background worker that runs the transcription at 20 second time intervals. We use [openai whisper](https://github.com/xenova/whisper-web) for transcription. Because of possible limitations in terms of hardware, whisper tiny was chosen such that the given time frame can be transcribed in the same time or less.

## Limitations

This extension uses the smallest possible version of the openai whisper model. The transcription accuracy may therefore be worse than other transcription solutions. Despite the small size of the model, the transcription process may use substantial system resources.

One of the most tumultuous periods of US politics was actually during the resolution of the immigration question.

We had them integrated, luckily actually at the time, with the industrial revolution. So we actually did have jobs for them. One of the problems is that today in the United States, we have one of the highest levels of foreign-born population than ever before.
